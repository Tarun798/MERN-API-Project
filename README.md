If you want to download the project first download or clown the project.
1) Go to backend (cd backend) and write npm i 
   It will help you to add all the missing packages that I have used in json.package file
2) Go to frotend (cd frontend) and write npm i
   It will help you to install react packages.
   
I have used axios to pass the API. 
MongoDB for the Database
React for the frontend
NodeJS for the backend
Express for the server 


Used MVC 
Model      : MongoDB Schema 
View       : React for the frontend
Controller : NodeJS for the backend - sometime ReactJS to get the data.
